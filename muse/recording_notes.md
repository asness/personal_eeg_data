## `2025-11-24--16-47-40`

- **Exercise**: interwoven body scan + breath sensation awareness + heart sensation awareness
- **Physical experiences**:
  - Popping and cracking from start to finish
  - Many minor and a few major internal physical realignments
- **Subjective experiences**:
  - A general impression of "peeling away" layers of sensation
