# Meditation session notes

## Introduction

In this doc, I'll jot down some experiential notes that may be useful when analyzing the Muse data.

## `muse/2025-11-24--16-47-40`

- **Exercise**: interwoven body scan + breath sensation awareness + heart sensation awareness
- **Physical experiences**:
  - Popping and cracking from start to finish
  - Many minor and a few major internal physical realignments
- **Subjective experiences**:
  - A general impression of "peeling away" layers of sensation

## `muse/2025-11-25--19-51-38`

Exercise as in `2025-11-24`.
Relatively more emphasis on vibrating sensations in the cranium, resulting in some intense feedback and the felt sense of brainwave pattern changes.

**Analysis notes**:
The feedback I described seems to show up in the recording as large fluctuations of alpha and theta in `AF8`, the front-right sensor.
